# Polygon MCP Server Improvements

This document outlines all the changes and improvements made to the Polygon MCP Server codebase.

## Recent Architectural Refactoring (March 28, 2025)

### 1. Centralized Configuration Management
- **Action:** Refactored `polygon-mcp.js` to consistently use `getConfig` from `common/config-manager.js`. Removed direct `process.env` reads in server startup and constructor.
- **Benefit:** Ensures consistent configuration loading and easier management.

### 2. Standardized Wallet Management
- **Action:** Removed local wallet instances and `connectWallet` methods from `defi-interactions.js`, `transaction-simulation.js`, and `contract-templates.js`. All modules now rely on the central `walletManager` singleton.
- **Benefit:** Ensures consistent wallet state, simplifies connection logic, and improves security.

### 3. Refactored Bridge Logic
- **Action:** Updated `polygon-mcp.js` to import and use the `PolygonBridge` class from `bridge-operations.js`. Removed direct `MaticPOSClient` usage and redundant methods from the main server file. Corrected hardcoded network configuration in `MaticPOSClient` initialization.
- **Benefit:** Aligns with modular architecture, improves code organization, and makes bridge logic more maintainable.

### 4. Centralized Utility Function
- **Action:** Created `common/utils.js` and moved the duplicated `resolveTokenAddress` function into it. Updated `polygon-mcp.js`, `transaction-simulation.js`, and `defi-interactions.js` to use the centralized utility.
- **Benefit:** Adheres to DRY principle, improves maintainability.

### 5. Code Quality Fixes
- **Action:** Addressed various ESLint errors (quotes, unused variables) introduced during the refactoring process.
- **Benefit:** Maintains code quality and consistency.

## Previous Structural Improvements (Pre-March 28 Refactor)

### 1. Common Directory Structure (Initial)
Created a centralized `common` directory for shared code:
- `constants.js` - Centralized token addresses and contract ABIs
- `config-manager.js` - Centralized configuration management (Initial version)
- `wallet-manager.js` - Singleton for wallet management across networks (Initial version)

### 2. Filename Fix
- Renamed `polygon MCP.js` to `polygon-mcp.js`.

### 3. ESLint Configuration
- Added `.eslintrc.js`.

### 4. Test Coverage
- Added `__tests__/wallet-manager.test.js`.

## Previous Code Improvements (Pre-March 28 Refactor)

### 1. Bridge Operations Fix (Initial)
- Fixed `bridge-operations.js` by replacing the non-existent `setWallet` method with proper client recreation (Now superseded by full refactor to use this class).

### 2. Environment Configuration
- Enhanced `.env.example`.
- Added DeFi protocol addresses and bridge configuration options.

### 3. MCP Tool Registration
- Expanded MCP tool registration in `polygon-mcp.js` to include advertised functionality.

### 4. Quote Style Standardization
- Updated quote styles in key files.

## Previous Security and Performance Improvements (Pre-March 28 Refactor)

### 1. Error Handling
- Improved error handling with contextualized error messages.
- Added proper validation of configurations and parameters.

### 2. Wallet Management (Initial Centralization)
- Centralized wallet management (initial step).
- Improved wallet connection validation.

### 3. Configuration Validation
- Added validation for required environment variables.
- Provided helpful error messages for missing configurations.

## Integration Guide (Historical - Refer to Git History for Specific Changes)

To integrate *previous* changes (before the latest refactor):

1. **Review modified files:** (Refer to relevant commits)
   - `polygon-mcp.js`
   - `bridge-operations.js`
   - `.env.example`
   - `.eslintrc.js`

2. **Add new files:** (Refer to relevant commits)
   - `common/constants.js`
   - `common/config-manager.js`
   - `common/wallet-manager.js`
   - `__tests__/wallet-manager.test.js`

3. **Test functionality:** (Refer to relevant commits)
   - Run ESLint: `npm run lint`
   - Run tests: `npm test`
   - Test MCP server.

These previous improvements enhanced code quality, maintainability, and functionality. The latest refactoring builds upon this foundation.
