# Polygon MCP Server Improvements

This document outlines all the changes and improvements made to the Polygon MCP Server codebase.

## Structural Improvements

### 1. Common Directory Structure
Created a centralized `common` directory for shared code:
- `constants.js` - Centralized token addresses and contract ABIs
- `config-manager.js` - Centralized configuration management
- `wallet-manager.js` - Singleton for wallet management across networks

### 2. Filename Fix
- Renamed `polygon MCP.js` to `polygon-mcp.js` to avoid filename space issues

### 3. ESLint Configuration
- Added `.eslintrc.js` with appropriate rules to match existing lint commands in package.json

### 4. Test Coverage
- Added `__tests__/wallet-manager.test.js` with proper Jest mocks for testing wallet functionality

## Code Improvements

### 1. Bridge Operations Fix
- Fixed `bridge-operations.js` by replacing the non-existent `setWallet` method with proper client recreation

### 2. Environment Configuration
- Enhanced `.env.example` with all required configuration parameters
- Added DeFi protocol addresses and bridge configuration options

### 3. MCP Tool Registration
- Expanded MCP tool registration in `polygon-mcp.js` to include all advertised functionality:
  - Wallet management tools
  - Bridge operation tools
  - Token operation tools
  - Gas estimation tools
  - Contract deployment tools
  - Transaction simulation tools

### 4. Quote Style Standardization
- Updated quote styles in key files to follow ESLint standards (single quotes)

## Security and Performance Improvements

### 1. Error Handling
- Improved error handling with contextualized error messages
- Added proper validation of configurations and parameters

### 2. Wallet Management
- Centralized wallet management for working with multiple networks
- Improved wallet connection validation

### 3. Configuration Validation
- Added validation for required environment variables
- Provided helpful error messages for missing configurations

## Integration Guide

To integrate these changes:

1. **Review modified files:**
   - `polygon-mcp.js` (renamed from `polygon MCP.js`)
   - `bridge-operations.js`
   - `.env.example`
   - `.eslintrc.js` (new)

2. **Add new files:**
   - `common/constants.js`
   - `common/config-manager.js`
   - `common/wallet-manager.js`
   - `__tests__/wallet-manager.test.js`

3. **Test functionality:**
   - Run ESLint to ensure code quality: `npm run lint`
   - Run tests to validate wallet manager: `npm test`
   - Test MCP server with example commands

These improvements enhance code quality, maintainability, and functionality while ensuring backward compatibility with existing interfaces.
