# Guide for Pushing Changes to GitHub

Here are step-by-step instructions for pushing the improvements to your GitHub repository:

## 1. Commit the New Files

First, commit the new files we've created:

```bash
# Navigate to your repository root (the parent folder of polygonmcp)
cd C:\Users\DBill\Documents\Cline\MCP

# Stage all the new files
git add polygonmcp/.eslintrc.js
git add polygonmcp/common/constants.js
git add polygonmcp/common/config-manager.js
git add polygonmcp/common/wallet-manager.js
git add polygonmcp/__tests__/wallet-manager.test.js
git add polygonmcp/IMPROVEMENTS.md

# Create a commit for the new files
git commit -m "Add new configuration, common modules, and tests"
```

## 2. Commit the Modified Files

Next, commit the files we've modified:

```bash
# Stage the modified files
git add polygonmcp/.env.example
git add polygonmcp/bridge-operations.js
git add polygonmcp/polygon-mcp.js

# Create a commit for the modified files
git commit -m "Fix bridge operations and update MCP tool registration"
```

## 3. Delete the File with Space in Name

If the original file with space in the name still exists and is tracked by Git:

```bash
# Remove the file with space from Git
git rm "polygonmcp/polygon MCP.js"
git commit -m "Remove file with space in filename"
```

## 4. Push All Changes to GitHub

Finally, push all the commits to your repository:

```bash
git push origin master
```
